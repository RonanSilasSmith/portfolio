                    Well to start, Hi! My name is Ronan Smith, but if you've come to this website I'm guessing you've learned that already. You may also know that I'm a Full Stack developer with experience in the MERN stack. I'm always looking for new ways to grow and learn, and I'm also currently looking for work! Links to contact me are in the well named "contact me" section or you can find them at the footer below!
        </p>
            </div>
        </section>
